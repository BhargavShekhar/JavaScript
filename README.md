# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn JavaScript. Here you'll find various scripts, projects, and exercises that I have completed while learning the language.

## Introduction

This repository contains JavaScript code that I have written while learning the language. It includes small exercises, mini-projects, and any other JavaScript-related experiments that I work on. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress and provide a place for others to see my code and provide feedback.
